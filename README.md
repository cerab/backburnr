## What is Backburnr?

Backburnr is a Chrome extension that helps to catalogue the pages you'd like to read or watch at a later date, as well as a tool that helps you pick what to come back to when you can't decide.

## How Does Backburnr Work?

Upon initial installation, Backburnr will create a new folder in your bookmarks titled "Backburnr" where the extension will store any bookmarks you create with it.

If you want to import a folder upon installation, simply rename whatever folder you'd like to use before installation to "Backburnr" and you're all set!

If you're a previous Backburnr user returning after a time away, as long as you still have your Backburnr folder, there's no need to reconnect manually. Backburnr's got it all sorted!

## Using Backburnr

#### Add

The "Add" button will add whatever tab is currently open to your Backburnr folder. No need to search out the folder manually, just one click!

#### Randomize

The "Randomize" button will assign the two selection buttons below to two random bookmarks in your Backburnr folder. When either of these selection buttons are clicked, it will open a new tab with one of your bookmarks! Additionally, when you hover over each of the buttons, you can see the title of the page to help aid in your decision between the two.
